# Breakout-clone
Breakout clone made using godot game-engine and gs.

## General Information
This project consists of a modern imitation of the first and only level of the popular arcade game Breakout and it
is made following the guidelines of [20 games challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io) as listed below.

The main purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with Godot and its tools, develop proper project organization
skills and to test my linear algebra knowledge.
Exploring Breakout's arcade era gameplay and mechanics is also an important factor to take into account.



## Technologies Used
- Godot game engine - v3.5.1
- GDScript

## Goals
- Create a game space with walls and a ceiling.
- Add a paddle that can be moved left and right via player inputs.
- Add a ball that will bounce off of the paddle, walls, and ceiling.
- Add square game objects (bricks) into the top of the game space.
- Enable the ball to bounce off of the bricks. When the ball bounces, the brick should disappear. 
    - Breaking a brick should add to the player’s score
    - The ball’s speed should increase as bricks are broken.
- The score should be displayed, as well as a life counter. The player starts with three lives. If the player misses the ball, a life should be subtracted. When all lives are used, the game ends.
